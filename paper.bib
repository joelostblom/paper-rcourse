	abstract = {This article discusses an emerging phenomenon of streaming programming to a live audience who in turn can interact with the streamer. In essence, this means broadcasting the programming environment and typically a web camera feed of the streamer to viewers. Streaming programming bears many similarities with live-streaming playing of video games, which has become extremely popular among gamers over the recent years. In fact, streaming programming often use the same web services as streaming gaming, and the audiences overlap. In this article, we describe this novel approach to programming and situate it in the broader context of computer science education. To gain a deeper insight into this phenomena, we analyzed viewer discussions during a particular programming stream broadcasted during a game programming competition. Finally, we discuss the benefits this approach could offer to computer science education.},

	abstract = {Live-coding is defined as "the process of designing and implementing a [coding] project in front of class during lecture period". In this article we present our research design and results regarding the effectiveness of live-coding to teach introductory programming. The research design includes two experimental groups spread across four sections of an introductory C++ course at Colorado School of Mines. In the control group, students were taught using static code, meaning that instructors never typed, but instead viewed, compiled, and executed code examples. In the experimental or "live-coding" group, instructors started each lecture with a blank screen, and taught code examples by systematically typing, compiling, and testing code to solve example problems. To assess the effectiveness of live-coding, we administered four surveys and analyzed final grades. Two of the surveys were given at the beginning of the course, and were used to measure baseline programming knowledge and student learning preferences (i.e., VARK). The other two surveys, given at the end of the course, were designed to measure the amount of programming knowledge obtained as well as preferences towards live coding. Lastly, final grades were analyzed in terms of its subcomponents: the assignments, exams, final project, and overall grade. Based on our results, we conclude that teaching via live-coding is as good as if not better than using static code examples.},

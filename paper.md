# Statement of Need

<!--
Describing why this material is beneficial to the community, why someone else would use it
-->

In traditional undergraduate biology education, students learn coding skills and biology concepts separately. This course, designed for third and fourth-year undergraduate students, fosters R coding skills in the context of learning statistics and ecology. Notably, the materials cover statistical concepts that are broadly useful in biology: linear regression, mixed effects models, randomization tests, principal component analyses, ANOVA and MANOVA, model selection, and numerically solving differential equations. We delivered these materials as a four month course, but these concepts are presented in stand-alone lectures designed by an interdisciplinary teaching team that could easily be mixed and matched to suit any desired course outcomes. The course is completely interactive: all lectures are designed to be delivered in a participatory live-coding format so that students learn experientally in real-time. The course materials also include assignments matched to lecture materials that sharpen students' understanding and allow them to critically apply their skills to new problems. Reproducible research skills are emphasized throughout, and the course culminates in an open-ended, self-directed project that allows students to apply their skills to real ecological data. The course repository is linked to an auto-generated website that presents the syllabus and materials and is easily modified by editing the course files on GitHub.

Bullet point version (can be removed after discussion):

* Students often learn coding skills and biology concepts separately, while this course fosters R coding skills in the context of learning statistics and ecology.
* Course contains stand-alone lectures that outline broadly useful statistical methods.
* Modular: lectures can be mixed and matched
* This course is completely interactive: all lectures are designed to be delivered in a participatory live-coding format so that students learn experientally in real-time.
* This course contains assignments that sharpen students' understanding and allow them to critically apply skills to new problems.  
* Students learn creativity and critical thinking through an open-ended, self-directed project that uses real ecological data.
* Students learn skills for reproducible research throughout the course.
* Course website - nice looking and easy to use
* We have taught this course twice and have refined the materials based on previous teaching experience

# Main Body


## Teaching Experience

For the first iteration of the course, our teaching team consisted of six
graduate students from several different fields (Physiology, Biomedical
Engineering, Physics, Psychology, and Nutritional Science); we divided course
topics among each instructor to develop and deliver individual lessons and
assignments to the eight participating students. After the core material had
been developed, we could reduce the number of instructors to four graduate
students for the second iteration (Physics, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
Psychology, and Cell and Systems Biology) although the number of students
increased to 26. We estimate that four instructors could effectively teach the
current iteration of the course to around 40 students.

To maximize the learning experience, we prioritized in-class participation,
engagement, and hands-on experience. The main teaching techniques we used to
achieve this were participatory live coding
[@rubin_effectiveness_2013;@haaranen_programming_2017;@wilson_teaching_2018]
where students were asked to complete partial solutions as we worked through
the material together, and project-based learning
[@sawyer_cambridge_2006;@strobel_when_2009;@markham_project_2011] where
students collaborated in teams on data analysis problems, similar to a real
world scenario.

To ensure that proper teaching assistance was available at all times, at least
two instructors were present for each lecture. One of these would act as
a "helper" and students signal their need for assistance by attaching
differently colored sticky notes to the back of their laptop monitor. This
method avoid interrupting the lecture flow when students need assistance and it
has been used successfully in workshops developed by The Carpentries
[@wilson-software-carpentry].

## Story of the project

While there are many excellent open source libraries for quantitative data
analysis, the use of less capable analysis tools (such as spreadsheet software)
is still prevalent among graduate students although these drastically reduce
analysis reproducibility, power and efficiency. Part of this issue stems from
lack of awareness, and part from that students are often required to learn
about new tools in isolation and on top of their main research activities. As
such, those that do embark on this daunting journey often quit before they can
reap the rewards of their efforts. Like-minded peers could provide the needed
support structure to uphold motivation, but are often few and far between,
especially in fields without a strong quantitative culture. To remedy these
issues, we launched the student group [UofT
Coders](http://uoftcoders.github.io/) which teaches how to use code for
research through skill sharing, co-working and community building in a friendly
environment.

After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback on content and teaching style,
we sought to formally share our experiences through the university
curriculum. We designed a course on open, reproducible data analysis, which we
created and taught as a fourth-year undergraduate course in the department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology under the title "Theoretical Ecology and
Reproducible Quantitative Methods in R." We modelled the structure and portions
of the course content after ["Reproducible Quantitative
Methods"](https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/) a course created by Dr.
Christie Bahlai, modifying the lesson content to include additional theoretical
ecology topics but maintaining the focus on reproducibility and computational
skills. Our teaching team consisted of six graduate students from several
different fields (Physiology, Biomedical Engineering, Physics, Psychology, and
Nutritional Science); we divided course topics among each instructor to develop
and deliver individual lessons and assignments.

Following a successful pilot term with a class of eight students, the course
was incorporated into the long-term curriculum and delivered a second time to a
class of twenty-six students with a teaching team of four graduate students
(Physics, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Psychology, and Cell and Systems
Biology). We modified our lecture material to include more generally applicable
statistical concepts and fewer theoretical ecology concepts, and renamed the
course ["Quantitative Methods in R for
Biology."](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/) to reflect this change. On
both occasions, the course received excellent feedback from the students and
the supervising professors.

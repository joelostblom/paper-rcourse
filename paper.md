# Statement of Need

# Main Body

## Story of the project

While there are many excellent open source libraries for quantitative data
analysis, the use of less capable analysis tools (such as spreadsheet software)
is still prevalent among graduate students although these drastically reduce
analysis reproducibility, power and efficiency. Part of this issue stems from
lack of awareness, and part from that students are often required to learn
about new tools in isolation and on top of their main research activities. As
such, those that do embark on this daunting journey often quit before they can
reap the rewards of their efforts. Like-minded peers could provide the needed
support structure to uphold motivation, but are often few and far between,
especially in fields without a strong quantitative culture. To remedy these
issues, we launched the student group [UofT
Coders](http://uoftcoders.github.io/) which teaches how to use code for
research through skill sharing, co-working and community building in a friendly
environment.

After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback on content and teaching style,
we sought to formally share our experiences through the university
curriculum. We designed a course on open, reproducible data analysis, which we
created and taught as a fourth-year undergraduate course in the department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology under the title "Theoretical Ecology and
Reproducible Quantitative Methods in R." We modelled the structure and portions
of the course content after ["Reproducible Quantitative
Methods"](https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/) a course created by Dr.
Christie Bahlai, modifying the lesson content to include additional theoretical
ecology topics but maintaining the focus on reproducibility and computational
skills. Our teaching team consisted of six graduate students from several
different fields (Physiology, Biomedical Engineering, Physics, Psychology, and
Nutritional Science); we divided course topics among each instructor to develop
and deliver individual lessons and assignments.

Following a successful pilot term with a class of eight students, the course
was incorporated into the long-term curriculum and delivered a second time to a
class of twenty-six students with a teaching team of four graduate students
(Physics, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Psychology, and Cell and Systems
Biology). We modified our lecture material to include more generally applicable
statistical concepts and fewer theoretical ecology concepts, and renamed the
course ["Quantitative Methods in R for
Biology."](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/) to reflect this change. On
both occasions, the course received excellent feedback from the students and
the supervising professors.
